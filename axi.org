#+TITLE: Snickerdoodle AXI notes

** FPGA Developer

The FPGA Developer tutorials start with this base system, based on the MicroZed board.

Then proceed to this axi loopback tutorial.

A previous version of the lookback tutorial using EDK instead of Vivado is here:
http://www.fpgadeveloper.com/2014/03/using-the-axi-dma-engine.html 
and it relied upon the Base System Builder

* Set up

Using a snickerdoodle black v4.1 with Vivado 2018.2

* create the base system using vivado

Even through the tutorial was based on the microzed board, it worked fine with the snickerdoodle black board.
